Research using Sentiment Analysis (NLTK and BERT) to understand public opinions towards Open Streets program in New York

This repository is used as part of an UCL Bartlett School of Planning Research project using mixed methods. The research angles from the perspective of urban planning practitioners and seeks to investigate how planners can harness social media data and sentiment analysis (SA) tools to enhance the planning process and encourage participatory planning by the general populace. The investigation uses the Open Streets program in New York City (NYC) as a case study to experiment and evaluate the best practices for planners to harness the potential of SA on social media data. The results of the research indicate that using VADER and BERT, the SA of tweets about Open Streets in NYC between 2020 and 2022 showed no statistical changes annually.

The method can be, in theory, applied to any other analysis involving the use of social media data. The data cleaning part will need to be changed according to the specific dataset.

The Twitter (X) data obtained strictly follows Twitter's Developer Agreement and Policy.
